# Animal Crossing Catalog / Museum Tracker

A tracking app made in React for the game Animal Crossing New Horizons.
Features a real time clock using momentjs and an option to find only bugs/fish available at the current time.

The app makes heavy use of the context api to keep track of the dark/light mode theme and the selected time options.

Deployed app can be found here: https://txh120530.github.io/ac-catalog/
